# buzzer-tunes
Simple Arduino code to let you easily write and buzz your favorite tunes.

You'll need to know the music in order to use this script. Inputs are:
 - The tempo
 - What note gets the beat
 - All the notes in the song in letter format
 - All the durations of those notes
 
 The buzzer is powered by pin 8 on an arduino, and I've added an LED on pin 7 that toggles every time a new note is played.
 
 Songs included so far are:
 - William Tell Overture: Finale (horse race song)
 - Hampsterdance
